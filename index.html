        <h3>Nice to meet you,</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Iâ€™m Marie-Lyse, and I'm based in Madrid since two years. I left Paris and its grey winter for the all-year-long sun (minus this day, it's rainingâ€¦) and smile of Spain. This is the third country I have moved to. Here are some hints of other countries Iâ€™ve lived into :
                <!-- -> insert kangourou, feuille dâ€™Ã©rable-->

            </li>
            <li>
                I'm currently transitioning into a new career (as this website is all about) and hope to become a Web Developer. I've always been curious and switched paths many times - from psychology through publishing to marketing; it's time for me to enter the Tech industry.

            </li>
        
        </ul>

        <h3> Why so?</h3>
        <p> I knew you were gonna askâ€¦ here is a non-exhaustive list of the reasons that motivated my choice :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                My last job made me unhappy - and let's be honest, life is too short to work for something you hate  <!--INSERT QUOTE HERE MAY BE - as my old pal said Â«Â Â Â»-->
            </li>
            <li>
                I wanted to contribute to the world of tomorrow instead of analyzing the world of yesterday (I was doing market research beforehand)
            </li>
            <li>
                The more I learn about Web development, the more I like it! I've missed this feeling of excitement these last years, and seriously, it's good to be back
            </li>
            <li>
                I've finally found a creative way to express myself that doesn't require being able to paint/draw in any way - I'm terrible at those things!
            </li>
        </ol>

    <p>This is me by the way, being happy with my choices</p>
